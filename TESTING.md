## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:-

1. Manually testing each element for appearance and responsiveness via a simulated live server using an extension in VSCode.
    
1. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with fellow students to test and received feedback.

### ***Manual Testing:***
* During testing, I used four different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The desktop browsers used by myself were:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Opera
  4. Edge

* I then used the devtools to simulate different screen sizes/devices from 320 px up to 4000px in width. CHECK THIS BEFORE PROJECT COMPLETION!!
* In addition to this, I also asked several people to test using iPhones and Apple Mac laptops/desktops using safari. These users reported no issues or bugs only style suggestions. CHECK THIS BEFORE PROJECT COMPLETION!!

### ***Bugs and Fixes:*** CHECK THIS BEFORE PROJECT COMPLETION!!

Below is a list of bugs I found during the development process by testing myself via the live server extension on VSCode. I tried each element for how the browser would display the page to potential users on a range of different screen widths from 320px to 4000px:-

### **Lighthouse Scores**
### **Test conditions**
* I did all lighthouse tests in incognito mode to avoid interference from browser extensions. 
* I ran the tests for both mobile and desktop. 
* I asked people to run lighthouse tests from their own devices. 
#### ***Desktop Version:***
I have only included one screenshot for desktop as all pages were the same score, only changing by one or two points in performance if I ran it multiple times.

**There were several actions required to get to this score:**

#### ***Mobile Version:*** CHECK THIS BEFORE PROJECT COMPLETION!!

* Due to the more significant variance in the performance score, I have included a screenshot for each mobile page. That being said when I asked one of my testers to check the mobile light house scores from his device his performance scores were all the high nineties.

### **Accessability** CHECK THIS BEFORE PROJECT COMPLETION!!
In addition to the accessability score on light house I also used [WAVE - Web accessability evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check my pages for accessability and no errors were returned.
