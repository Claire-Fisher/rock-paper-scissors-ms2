# Planning and Development
### Target Audiences
- Users of all age groups.
- Users who are looking to spend some time on a simple game.
- Users who want a game for a couple of seconds, to a couple of minutes, and beyond.
- Users who want a clear and easy-to-use game with simple, familiar rules.
- Users who want entertaining while waiting for something (commuters, patients in a waiting room etc).

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be entertained.
2. As a user, I want to have a positive user experience.
3. As a user, I want the game to be intuitive and the rules easy to find.
4. As a user, I want to use the project across multiple devices.
5. As a travelling user, I want to be able to play the game with my mobile device in one hand, while I hold onto a transport safety rail, or bags of groceries.
6. As a differently abled user, I want the buttons and text to be of good contrast and larger size for accessiblity.  
7. As a colour blind user, I want the project to work clearly in grayscale.

### Site Objectives
- To provide a positive user experience.
- To create an intuitive UI that provides good site flow.
- To build a family-friendly game that is appropriate for all ages.
- To build a single-finger playable game. 
- To deliver a game that is responsive on a large variety of screen sizes and mobile devices.
- To create a fast, easy-to-use game that can be enjoyed in less than 1 minute.
- To deliver a game that implements accessibility needs to a high level.

### Approach
- Mobile first design.
- The game functionality will be provided to the user logically and intuitively.
- The site will be created following the principles of user experience design.
- The content of the site will be inoffensive and accessible to all.
- Clean, professional design, with consistent colour-scheme, style and layouts throughout.

### Research
The following sites were examined as part of my project research:
- https://www.online-stopwatch.com/chance-games/rock-paper-scissors/
- https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-rock-paper-scissors
- https://www.twoplayergames.org/game/rock-paper-scissors

Common themes found:
  - Responsive design.
  - Neutral backgrounds to page styling.
  - Colourful, busy designs, auto-played music.

My adjustments to suit my project aims:
  - Less colour. Keep to a greyscale palette for better accessibility. 
  - Clearer feedback to the user on their choice and the AI choice. 
  - No auto play music that can reduce a users positive UX.
  - A best of three outcome. A game that has a definite win or lose outcome is more satisfying to the user. 

### Wireframes

Procreate was used to document research, sketch out initial ideas, page layouts and wireframes.

This planning and development work is uploaded to Figma. The design page on Figma is a useful tool to layout all my early project documents in one space, and share online with others for additional input. It allowed my mentor to quickly view and understand my project themes and objectives.

Using Figma's wireframes capabilities, I was able to play with initial layouts and plan intuitive flow around my site. This has given me a good understanding of how an MVP might be presented to me by a frontend designer.

### Colour Scheme
![Image of colour palette](/documents/readme-images/rps-colour-scheme.png)
A reduced colour scheme of three greys (#f9f9f9, #c9c9c9, #222222) has been chosen for this project. The advantages of this are as follows:
  - Clean, professional design with universal appeal.
  - Reduced screen glare for all users as lightest shade is off-white, and darkest is off-black. 
  - Better accommodates users with higher visual requirements.
  - Project also displays extremely well on mobile devices set to dark mode.  

### Typography
'Inter" from Google Fonts was selected throughout as a clear, easily-readable font choice. [View here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter)

# Features
### General
- The site is fully responsive and functional on all screen sizes down to 320px.
- The site considers different user's sensory perceptions and reduces screen glare by softening white to a off-white (#f9f9f9), and black to a dark-grey (#222).
- The site uses semantic elements to assist screen reader users to navigate and access information.

### Logo
- The logo format will be text based inline with the project clean and simplistic style choice.
- The logo colours will match the colour pallette of the site for brand consistency. 

### Navigation
- A navigation bar is unnecessary for this single-page project. 
- User input can be selected intuitively from large button choices dominating the page. 
- Game rules can be found intuitively via an obvious interactive button that toggles a modal of information.

### Images
- Images are intentionally very limited to prioritse project performance. Animated gifs are included to represent user win or loss respectively. This adds to a positive user experience. A win result randomly selects 1 of 5 win gif. A lose result always displays the same Game Over gif. 

### The Footer
The footer will be limimted to simple copyright information. It cannot be interacted with by user. 

# Future Features
### Feedback Form
Include a button link to a feedback form page. Users can be invited to report bugs, ask for future features, or suggest accessibility improvements.  

### Link to additional games 
Additional game versions, or game types could be added. A drop-down menu to those options would add additional positive user experience. It would also keep the user on the product longer. 

### Difficulty setting
Have an option the user can toggle to change the difficulty of the game. Harder levels might calculate the computer has a 50% change to select the winning weapon based on the user's choice etc. 

### AI personality
More conversational responses from the AI could be included to give the AI a "personality".

### AI personality Expanded
Have an option the user can toggle to select a "nice" or a "mean" AI opponent.

### Advertising 
An advertising banner could be added to promote other content from the same publisher. Or adverts supplied by third party companies to monetise the project.

- After a mentor session with Richard Wells. We unpicked my animated countdown I'd coded with JQuery. Explored the .promise() and .done() methods and improved the code.
