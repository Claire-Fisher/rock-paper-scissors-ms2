# Planning and Development

### Target Audiences

- Users who are looking to waste some time on a simple game.
- Users who want a game for a couple of seconds, to a couple of minutes, and beyond.
- Users who want a clear and easy-to-use game with simple, familiar rules.
- Users who want entertaining while waiting for something (commuters, patients in a waiting room etc).

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be entertained.
- As a user, I want to be occupied.
- As a user, I want to have a positive user experience.
- As a user, I want the game to be intuitive and the rules easy to find.
- As a user, I want to use the project across multiple devices.
- As a differently abled user, I want the buttons and text to be of good contrast and larger size for accessiblity.  
- As a colour blind user, I want the project to work clearly in grayscale.

### Site Objectives

- To provide a positive user experience.
- To create an intuitive UI that provides good site flow.
- To build a family-friendly game that is appropriate for all ages.
- To deliver a game that is responsive on a large variety of screen sizes and mobile devices.
- To create a fast, easy-to-use game that can be enjoyed in less than 1 minute.
- To deliver a game that implements accessibility needs.

### Approach

- The game functionality will be provided to the user logically and intuitively.
- The site will be created following the principles of user experience design.
- The content of the site will be inoffensive and accessible to all.
- The site will be easy to navigate, intuitive and consistent in design.

### Research

- EXAMPLE DONT LEAVE THIS IN!! The following sites were examined as part of my project research:

- EXAMPLE DONT LEAVE THIS IN!! Common themes found:
  - Responsive design.
  - Neutral backgrounds to page styling.
  - Lists of psychological words connected to each colour.
  - Site logo's top left (user expected location, intuitive design).
  - Navigation link top (user expected location, intuitive design).
  - Grey font used on white/light backgrounds. Softer for sensory perception.
  - Examples cited of how each colour is used in design concepts.
  - Colour quotes.
  - Video content exploring colour psychology further.
- My adjustments to suit my project target audience:
  - Switched the word "Psychology" for "Theory" to be less intimidating for a younger user (Except for psychology word lists).

### Wireframes

- Procreate was used to document research, sketch out initial ideas, page layouts and wireframes.
- This planning and development work was uploaded to Figma. The design page on Figma is a useful tool to layout all my early project documents in one space, and share online with others for additional input. It allowed my mentor to quickly view and understand my project themes and objectives.
- Using Figma's wireframes capabilities, I was able to play with initial layouts and plan intuitive flow around my site. This has given me a good understanding of how an MVP might be presented to me by a frontend designer.
- I focused on a mobile first development ethos.

### Colour Scheme

- There are no colour restrictions for this project.
- A neutral colour palette of two greys ranging from light to midtone, and black have been chosen to meet accessibilty needs and keep the project clean, professional, and classc. This limited choice is also a bid for the widest user appeal.

### Typography

- 'Inter" from Google Fonts was selected throughout as a clear, easily-readable font choice.

# Features

### General

- The site is fully responsive and functional on all screen sizes down to 320px.
- The site considers different user's sensory perceptions and reduces screen glare by softening white to a off-white, and black to a dark-grey.
- The site uses semantic elements to assist screen reader users to navigate and access information.

### Logo

- The logo format will be text based inline with the project clean and simplistic style choice.
- The logo colours will match the colour pallette of the site for brand consistency. 

### Navigation

- A navigation bar is unnecessary for this single-page project. 
- User input can be selected intuitively from large button choices dominating the page. 
- Game rules can be found intuitively via an obvious interactive button that will toggle a pop-up window of information.

### Images

- EXAMPLE DONT LEAVE THIS IN!! Images will be very limited, if featured at all. This is to maximise loading and running times. Animated gifs may be included to represent user win or loss respectively. This would add to a positive user experience. 


### The Footer

- The footer will be limimted to simple copyright information. It cannot be interacted with by user. 

# Future Features

### Link to additional games 

- Additional game versions, or game types could be added. A drop-down menu to those options would add additional positive user experience. It would also keep the user on the product longer. 

### Advertising 

- An advertising banner could be added to promote other content from the same publisher. Or adverts supplied by third party companies to monetise the project.

- After a mentor session with Richard Wells. We unpicked my animated countdown I'd coded with JQuery. Explored the .promise() and .done() methods and improved the code.
